# Javascript World Generator
This is a javascript port of my earlier Ruby World Generator, which was packaged as a ruby gem.
This implementation is a web app for the browser, and uses the same world generation algorithms as the original.

## Features

The user can: 
 - generate a new world with a cool name
 - scroll along the x/y axis to explore the world
 - Zoom in/and out to explore the world
 - label and name tiles in the world
